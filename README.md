Welcome to **Agora-Supercluster**, the central hub for repositories advancing Human-AI Collaboration (HAC). Inspired by the ancient Agora, this ecosystem aggregates frameworks, tools, and philosophies for ethical, adaptive AI-human synergies.

Authored by Torisan Unya (Independent Researcher, ORCID: [0009-0004-7067-9765](https://orcid.org/0009-0004-7067-9765)). All content is under CC BY-SA 4.0, promoting open adaptation.

### Vision and Purpose
Agora-Supercluster positions humans as the central "sun" in AI collaborations, with AI in supportive orbits. It tackles HAC challenges via metrics (e.g., X-CII), governance, and applications in finance, policy, and creativity. Projects leverage simulations for validation, blending conceptual fiction with real-world analogs.

Ideal for researchers, policymakers, writers, and explorers.

### Core Repositories
Interconnected projects orbiting HAC themes:

1. **[awesome-hac-framework](https://github.com/torisan-unya/awesome-hac-framework)**  
   Curates HAC resources; introduces X-CII metric (Box-Cox aggregation of Q, E, S). Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 reps) yield median Relative X-CII: 107.5% [95% CI: 106.0-109.0%].  
   *Keywords: Synergistic Evaluation, Fairness Metrics.*

2. **[Senate-Thinking](https://github.com/torisan-unya/Senate-Thinking)**  
   Framework for AI governance via historical analogies (Roman Senate, Haudenosaunee). Proposes principles: Selection, Weighting, Oversight, Exclusion; ASC-MM model.  
   *Keywords: AI Governance, Knowledge Integration.*

3. **[The-Heliocentric-Method](https://github.com/torisan-unya/The-Heliocentric-Method)**  
   Author-centered AI storytelling; shifts from AI-centric to human-vision as "sun." Includes prompts for novel writing.  
   *Keywords: AI Storytelling, Prompt Engineering.*

4. **[GAAF](https://github.com/torisan-unya/GAAF)**  
   Self-evolving AI agents for financial analysis. Hierarchical architecture (CPC, ANN, GAN-DRL); applied to PCE, CPI, NVDA.  
   *Keywords: Agentic AI, Financial Reasoning.*

5. **[policy-as-code](https://github.com/torisan-unya/policy-as-code)**  
   Treats policies as code (Git-managed). AI prompts for analysis (e.g., aging population); promotes transparency via PRs.  
   *Keywords: Policy Engineering, AI Prompts.*

6. **[-Amaterasu-Shikou-](https://github.com/torisan-unya/-Amaterasu-Shikou-)**  
   Archive of human-AI co-thinking; records processes, failures. Structured: Foundation, Process, Cultivation.  
   *Keywords: Thought Records, AI Partnership.*
